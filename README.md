# Machine_learning_projects-b-
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! Here, I post my code and projects related to various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Current Projects
1. Logistic Regression
2. 
Description: This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification problems. It covers data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

3. Descision Trees:
   
   This project demonstrates the implementation of "Decision+Trees_on_creditScore.ipynb"

5. 

Files:

log_reg_MYCREDIT.ipynb:   Contains the complete implementation of the logistic regression model.
